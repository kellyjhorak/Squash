1,PFBS,"Perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) is used as a replacement for PFOS in various industrial applications. Although considered less bioaccumulative than PFOS, studies indicate it may still persist in the environment and pose health risks such as endocrine disruption.",25.000
2,PFHxA,Perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) is a short-chain PFAS commonly used in manufacturing. Its lower bioaccumulation potential does not eliminate concerns regarding its mobility in water and potential toxic effects on liver function and development.,15.000
3,PFPeA,"Perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) is recognized for its high environmental mobility. It can rapidly spread in water systems, and emerging research suggests it may contribute to adverse health effects, including developmental toxicity.",10.000
4,PFHxS,"Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) is frequently found in firefighting foams and industrial processes. It is persistent in the environment and has been linked to immune and developmental toxicity, raising concerns about long-term exposure.",20.000
5,PFOA,"Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been widely used in non-stick cookware and industrial applications. Known for its persistence and bioaccumulation, PFOA is associated with a range of health risks, including cancer, thyroid disease, and developmental issues.",20.000
6,PFBA,"Perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) is a short-chain PFAS with limited bioaccumulation. However, its widespread use in consumer products and industrial applications raises concerns over its potential to contaminate water sources and affect human health.",10.000
7,PFHpA,"Perfluoroheptanoic acid (PFHpA) is detected in various environmental samples. Though data on its toxicity are still emerging, there is concern that it could contribute to similar adverse health effects as its longer-chain counterparts.",15.000
8,PFOS,"Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) has been historically used in firefighting foams and stain repellents. Its persistence in the environment and bioaccumulative nature make it dangerous, with links to immune system disruption and developmental problems.",30.000
9,PFHpS,"Perfluoroheptanesulfonic acid (PFHpS) is a lesser-studied PFAS compound. Early studies suggest it may have similar properties to PFOS, potentially impacting liver function and hormone regulation, though more research is needed to fully assess its risks.",15.000
10,PFPes,"Perfluoropentanesulfonic acid (PFPes) is currently under investigation for its environmental impact. Preliminary research indicates that, despite its shorter chain length, it may still contribute to toxic effects in wildlife and humans, particularly affecting hormonal balance.",15.000
11,PFDA,"Perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA) is a long-chain PFAS commonly associated with industrial emissions. Its persistence and potential for bioaccumulation raise concerns about chronic exposure risks, including carcinogenicity and liver toxicity.",20.000
12,PFUnDA,"Perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) is a long-chain PFAS found in various environmental matrices. Research indicates it may accumulate in living organisms and contribute to adverse health outcomes, such as developmental and immune system effects.",25.000
13,PFDoDA,"Perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) is a long-chain PFAS with notable persistence in the environment. Its potential to bioaccumulate in both wildlife and humans is a cause for concern, with possible links to hormonal disruptions and other toxic effects.",25.000
14,PFOSA,"Perfluorooctane sulfonamide (PFOSA) is a PFAS precursor that can break down into more persistent compounds. Used in the production of fluoropolymers, PFOSA poses risks due to its potential to convert into PFOS-like substances, which are known for their toxicity.",30.000
15,GenX (HFPO-DA),"Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid, known as GenX, is used as a replacement for PFOA. While designed to be less persistent, concerns remain regarding its environmental mobility and possible links to liver and developmental toxicity.",10.000
16,ADONA,"Perfluoro-3,6-dioxaheptanoic acid (ADONA) is an alternative PFAS used in select industrial applications. Although it may have a lower bioaccumulation potential, its environmental fate and long-term health impacts are still being studied, with early signs pointing to potential toxic risks.",10.000
